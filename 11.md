During the interview, the candidate presented his experience at a relatively high level of abstraction, with a stronger focus on business context than on technical depth.

When discussing technologies listed in his CV and LinkedIn profile, his answers remained rather general and lacked concrete examples demonstrating hands-on experience. In particular, he was unable to clearly specify the .NET framework versions he had worked with.

In the area of database integration in .NET/C#, the candidate referred to ORM usage but did not provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of practical implementation approaches. His responses suggested familiarity with concepts, though without demonstrating deeper technical understanding.

Overall, while the candidate appears to have general exposure to .NET-related topics, he did not convincingly demonstrate strong technical depth expected for a senior-level role.
