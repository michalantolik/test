The interview with the candidate was very smooth and natural, with strong mutual understanding and high-quality communication throughout the discussion.

The candidate demonstrated broad interest in software development and solid technical depth across multiple areas. He was able to describe his experience in a structured and detailed manner, focusing on concrete technical aspects rather than remaining at a high level.

He showed strong engagement, enthusiasm for programming, and a clear passion for his work. At the same time, he presented a pragmatic mindset and awareness of real-world engineering challenges, including the need to balance business requirements with technical excellence.

The candidate expressed willingness to work both with modern technologies and legacy systems. He appears to be collaborative, team-oriented, and capable of working effectively with developers, managers, and business stakeholders.

Overall, I consider the candidate a very strong match for the role and would recommend moving forward.
